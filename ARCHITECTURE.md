# Conway's Game of Life API - Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Conway's Game of Life API, a RESTful service that implements Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. The API allows users to upload board states, compute next generations, and find stable states.

## Architecture Principles

The solution follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the core domain model
3. **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open-closed, etc.
4. **RESTful API Design**: Resource-oriented endpoints with appropriate HTTP methods
5. **Production Readiness**: Error handling, validation, monitoring, and performance optimization

## Solution Structure

The solution is organized into the following projects:

### ConwayGameOfLife.Api

The API layer responsible for handling HTTP requests, input validation, and response formatting.

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Models**: DTOs for request and response objects
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for error handling, rate limiting, etc.
- **Validation**: Custom validation attributes and validators

### ConwayGameOfLife.Core

The domain layer containing the core business logic and domain models.

- **Models**: Domain entities like Board and Cell
- **Services**: Business logic for Conway's Game of Life rules
- **Interfaces**: Abstractions for services and repositories

### ConwayGameOfLife.Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer handling data persistence and external dependencies.

- **Data**: Database context, entity configurations, and migrations
- **Repositories**: Data access implementations
- **Services**: External service implementations

### ConwayGameOfLife.Tests

The test layer containing unit and integration tests.

- **Unit**: Unit tests for individual components
- **Integration**: Tests that verify the interaction between components
- **Fixtures**: Test data and helpers

### ConwayGameOfLife.Benchmarks

Performance benchmarking project for measuring and optimizing performance.

- **Benchmarks**: Performance tests for critical operations

## Key Components

### Board State Management

- **Board Model**: Represents a game board with a grid of cells
- **Cell Model**: Represents a single cell in the grid
- **BoardState Entity**: Persists board states in the database
- **BoardStateRepository**: Handles CRUD operations for board states

### Game Logic

- **GameOfLifeService**: Implements Conway's Game of Life rules
- **ComputeNextGeneration**: Calculates the next generation of a board
- **ComputeGenerations**: Calculates the board state after N generations
- **ComputeFinalState**: Finds the final stable state of a board

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/gameoflife/board**: Upload a new board state
- **GET /api/gameoflife/{id}/next**: Get the next generation of a board
- **GET /api/gameoflife/{id}/generations/{n}**: Get the board state after N generations
- **GET /api/gameoflife/{id}/final**: Get the final stable state of a board

## Data Flow

1. **Client** sends a request to the API
2. **Controller** validates the request and maps it to domain objects
3. **Service** processes the request using domain logic
4. **Repository** persists or retrieves data from the database
5. **Controller** maps the domain response to a DTO and returns it to the client

## Production Readiness Features

### Error Handling

- Global exception handling middleware
- Structured error responses
- Logging of exceptions with context

### Validation

- Input validation using data annotations
- Custom validation attributes
- Model state validation in controllers

### Performance Optimization

- Parallel processing for large boards
- Efficient algorithms for board state computation
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Monitoring and Health Checks

- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Database connectivity checks
- Detailed health check responses

### Security

- Rate limiting middleware
- Input validation to prevent malicious data
- No sensitive information exposed in responses

### DevOps

- Docker support for containerization
- Docker Compose for local development
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

## Design Decisions

### Board Representation

The board is represented as a 2D grid of boolean values, where `true` represents a live cell and `false` represents a dead cell. This representation is:

- Memory efficient
- Easy to serialize/deserialize
- Simple to manipulate

### Persistence Strategy

Board states are persisted in a SQLite database:

- Each board state is stored as a separate record
- The grid is serialized as a string for storage
- Indexes are used for efficient retrieval

### Cycle Detection

To detect cycles in board evolution:

- A dictionary of board states is maintained
- String representation of boards is used as keys
- When a previously seen state is encountered, a cycle is detected

### Parallel Processing

For large boards (more than 50x50 cells):

- Parallel processing is used to compute the next generation
- Each row is processed in parallel
- This improves performance on multi-core systems

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed board states
2. **Background Processing**: Implement background processing for large boards
3. **Visualization**: Add visualization capabilities
4. **Different Rule Sets**: Support for different cellular automaton rules
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimize for large boards
6. **Authentication and Authorization**: Add user authentication and authorization
7. **Distributed Caching**: Implement distributed caching for scalability
8. **Metrics Collection**: Add metrics collection and monitoring
